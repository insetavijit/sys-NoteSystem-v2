When pitching **WordPress installation** (or any WP service), the trick is to talk less about _what you do_ (“I’ll install WordPress”) and more about _what the client gets_ (“You’ll have a working, secure, ready-to-use website in less than an hour”).

Here’s a breakdown for pitching effectively:

---

## **1. Start With the Client’s Problem**

Most clients:

- Don’t understand hosting or databases
    
- Fear breaking something
    
- Just want a site they can start editing today
    

**Example opening:**

> “Don’t waste hours figuring out hosting or WordPress setup — I’ll get your site live, secure, and ready to edit today.”

---

## **2. Sell the Outcome, Not Just the Task**

Instead of:

> “I’ll install WordPress on your hosting.”

Say:

> “You’ll get a fully installed and secure WordPress site, connected to your domain, with login details in your inbox — ready to use immediately.”

---

## **3. Add Trust Builders**

- Mention your experience (“I’ve set up 50+ WordPress sites”)
    
- Highlight speed (“Most installs done in under 1 hour”)
    
- Offer a small guarantee (“If you’re not happy, you don’t pay”)
    

---

## **4. Show the Package, Not Just the Single Item**

Example “Starter Website Setup” package:

1. Install WordPress
    
2. Connect domain & SSL
    
3. Add security plugin & caching plugin
    
4. Basic performance tuning
    
5. Send login credentials + mini getting-started guide
    

Price it at $75–$150 instead of $25–$40 — clients love bundles.

---

## **5. Give a Clear Call to Action**

Example:

> “Send me your hosting login details, and I’ll have your WordPress site live today. I’ll also include free SSL setup so it’s secure from the start.”

Got it — you want a **practical, step-by-step guide** for providing the _WordPress installation_ service to clients, from start to finish.

Here’s the **complete workflow** you can follow every time:

---

## **Step 1 – Gather Client Information**

Before touching anything, get:

1. **Hosting login** (cPanel, Plesk, or hosting dashboard)
    
2. **Domain registrar login** (if you need to connect domain)
    
3. **Preferred WordPress admin username, email, and password**
    
4. Any **special settings** (language, site title, timezone)
    
5. If they already have SSL or want you to set it up
    

---

## **Step 2 – Access Hosting**

- Log in to **cPanel** (most common) or other hosting control panel
    
- Locate:
    
    - **File Manager** or FTP
        
    - **MySQL Databases**
        
    - **Softaculous** or **One-click installer** (if available)
        

---

## **Step 3 – Install WordPress**

### **Option A – One-Click Install (Fastest)**

4. Select the latest version of WordPress
    
5. Enable SSL (if available)
    
6. Install
    

### **Option B – Manual Install (More Control)**

1. **Download** latest WP from wordpress.org
    
2. **Upload** files to the root directory (e.g., `/public_html`) via File Manager or FTP
    
3. Create a **MySQL database** and user → assign user to DB with _All Privileges_
    
4. Edit `wp-config.php` with DB details
    
5. Visit the site in browser to complete installation wizard

## **Step 4 – Configure Basic Settings**

---

## **Step 8 – Deliver to Client**

    - WordPress admin URL
        
    - Username & password
        
    - Short instructions (how to log in, change password)
        
- Offer an **upsell**: theme setup, SEO basics, or maintenance
