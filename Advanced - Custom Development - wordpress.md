Alright ‚Äî let‚Äôs unpack **Advanced / Custom WordPress Development** so you can see exactly what it involves, the skills needed, and how freelancers turn it into high-paying work.

---

## **1. What It Means**

‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù or ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù development goes beyond clicking in the admin panel or using page builders.  
It‚Äôs where you work directly with **WordPress core functions, hooks, APIs, and code** to build **features that don‚Äôt exist out-of-the-box**.

This is where clients pay **hundreds to thousands** because:

- It‚Äôs specialized
    
- It solves unique problems
    
- Few freelancers can do it well

## **4. [[Skills Needed - Wordpress devl]]**

To get into this tier, you need:

- **[[Core WordPress]]**: Hooks (actions & filters), Template hierarchy, Loop
- **[[PHP]]**: For backend logic
- **[[MySQL]]**: For custom queries
- **[[JavaScript]]**: For AJAX, dynamic UI, REST API calls
- **[[REST API  GraphQL]]**: For headless setups or integrations

#### Groups to Concore
1. [[Core WordPress]]
2. [[Programming Languages & Concepts]]
3. [[WordPress APIs You Should Know]]
4. [[Development Tools & Practices]]

üí° **How to Approach Learning**  
Instead of trying to learn _everything_ at once, pick **one advanced service** (e.g., ‚ÄúCustom Post Types + ACF‚Äù or ‚ÄúWooCommerce custom checkout‚Äù) and learn the skills that support that service first. This way, you build **income-ready skills** while expanding your expertise.

If you want, I can create a **[[layered skills roadmap]]** showing exactly which of these skills to learn **month by month**, so you can go from ‚Äútheme customizer‚Äù level to ‚Äúfull custom WordPress developer‚Äù in a structured path.  
That would also include _real mini-projects_ for each stage so you learn by doing.
